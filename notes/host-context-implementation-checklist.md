# Host Context Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the remaining work needed to make Hosts first-class across projects, tasks, automations, SSH, remote servers, and future cloud VMs.

The target model is:

- **Project** is the durable logical project.
- **Project host setup** means that project exists on a specific host at a specific path.
- **Task source context** means which host/account/provider is used to fetch or mutate external work items.
- **Run host** means where a workspace, agent, automation, terminal, clone, or command executes.
- Source context and run host are explicit, may differ, and should not be inferred from ambient client state.

## Checklist Status

- [ ] Not started.
- [~] In progress or partially covered.
- [x] Complete and verified.

## 1. Shared Model And Naming

- [x] Add a shared TaskSourceContext type that captures provider, host/source target, logical project id, optional projectHostSetupId, and provider-specific identity such as owner/repo, GitLab project id, Linear workspace/team, or Jira site/project.
- [x] Add a shared run-target type or selector for RunHostContext / WorkspaceRunContext so workspace creation, agent launch, automations, and remote execution use the same vocabulary.
- [x] Audit user-facing copy so the product says **Host** for Local Mac, SSH hosts, remote servers, and future cloud VMs, while preserving technical labels only where useful.
- [x] Document the invariant that task source context and run host are separate choices.
- [x] Add compatibility adapters for existing repo-id/path-based callers so old data can be read while new code moves to explicit contexts.
- [x] Add schema migration notes for old automations, cached task selections, pending worktree requests, and any persisted task drawer state.

Done means: a new agent can read the shared types and understand exactly where work item data comes from versus where execution happens.

## 2. Provider Routing And Task Data

- [x] Update GitHub issue/PR listing to accept an explicit TaskSourceContext instead of deriving from selected repo, path, or active runtime state.
- [x] Update GitHub drawer mutations such as comment, state change, assignment, label, branch creation, and review actions to preserve the same source context as the list item.
- [x] Update GitHub cache keys to include provider identity and source host/runtime identity so two hosts with different GitHub accounts cannot collide.
- [x] Update GitLab IPC/preload/main handlers to accept explicit project/source context instead of path-only selectors.
- [x] Guard or retire GitLab path-only fallbacks where they can mutate or fetch from the wrong host.
- [x] Update Linear routing to use an explicit source account/workspace context instead of settings.activeRuntimeEnvironmentId.
- [x] Update Jira routing to use an explicit source account/site/project context instead of settings.activeRuntimeEnvironmentId.
- [x] Add provider diagnostics that show which host/account/site a task source is using.
- [~] Add error states for unavailable source hosts, missing provider auth, unsupported provider on host, and version-skewed remote servers.

Done means: if Machine A and Machine B have different provider accounts, every list and mutation goes through the user-selected source context.

## 3. Tasks UI

- [x] Add an explicit source-context picker or display for Tasks that can represent host, provider account, and project/source.
- [x] Decide and implement the default Tasks view when a logical project exists on multiple hosts.
- [x] Support switching the task source without changing the current run host.
- [x] Show enough account/host metadata to make mismatched GitHub/GitLab/Linear/Jira accounts understandable.
- [x] Persist task source context in task drawer URLs/state so refresh, deep links, and reopen preserve the same source.
- [x] Ensure task drawer actions reuse the drawer item source context, not a global provider default.
- [x] Add disabled/auth-needed/disconnected states for source hosts.
- [x] Add empty states explaining when a project has no configured task source on the selected host.

Done means: users can tell where Tasks are being fetched from, and changing execution host does not silently change provider data.

## 4. New Workspace Modal, Start Work, And Workspace Creation

- [x] Split “start from task/issue/PR” source context from workspace run target in New Workspace modal state.
- [x] When opening the New Workspace modal from Tasks, preselect the logical project and a reasonable run host without treating the source repo as the only execution target.
- [x] Ensure pending worktree/workspace creation persists both the source task context and selected run host.
- [x] Make “create workspace on host” only show hosts where the project has a ProjectHostSetup.
- [x] Keep “add project to host” as the path for making a project available on another host; do not present workspace creation as if Orca is responsible for bootstrapping repos/dependencies.
- [x] Update clone/browse/create project flows so selected host is not repeated as a fake editable SSH field.
- [x] Ensure clone destination defaults are human and host-appropriate, and allow changing the clone location where the host supports it.
- [x] Improve clone error messages for existing destination paths with the actual path and next action.
- [x] Ensure PR/MR base resolution uses source context for provider data and run host context for local/remote git commands.

Done means: starting work from an external item carries the item’s source identity separately from where the agent will run.

## 5. Automations

- [~] Migrate Automation.projectId away from repo-id semantics toward logical project id plus explicit run host/project host setup.
- [x] Store automation source context separately from automation run context.
- [x] Snapshot source context and run context on each automation run for auditability and retry safety.
- [x] Update automation dispatch/precheck code to validate selected run host availability and project host setup.
- [x] Verify automation live lookups do not use ambient settings: current Orca automations do not fetch issue/PR/task lists during dispatch, and branch/base-ref lookup routes through the selected repo host.
- [x] Update session reuse logic so an automation never resumes on the wrong host.
- [x] Add disabled states for disconnected run host, missing project host setup, missing source auth, unavailable source tool, and unsupported provider.
- [x] Add migration behavior for old automations that only know a repo id/path.
- [x] Update CLI/RPC automation APIs with v2 selectors for logical project, source context, and run host.

Done means: scheduled or manual automations behave predictably when a project exists on multiple hosts or providers differ by host.

## 6. Settings, Accounts, And Host Ownership

- [x] Clarify which settings are client-owned versus host-owned.
- [x] Add host/account selectors to provider settings where credentials may differ by host.
- [x] Make provider rate limits, diagnostics, and “current account” views show their host/source context.
- [x] Audit source-control AI, agent defaults, command defaults, and model selections for whether they should be client-global or host-scoped.
- [x] Preserve existing Windows/WSL-style setting patterns where they already solve host-specific settings.
- [x] Ensure remote server version/capability information is visible enough to explain unavailable controls.

Done means: settings pages no longer imply one global provider/account when the action may be host-owned.

## 7. Cache, Request Ownership, And Runtime Compatibility

- [~] Audit caches keyed by repo id, path, owner/repo, or active runtime and add host/source identity where needed.
- [~] Ensure request ownership is explicit for provider fetches, provider mutations, file-system calls, git calls, terminal calls, and automation runs.
- [x] Add capability negotiation for remote servers so new clients can degrade gracefully with older servers.
- [x] Add version-skew UX for unsupported source-context or host-context APIs.
- [x] Ensure SSH hosts and remote servers expose comparable availability/health states to the UI.
- [x] Keep future cloud VM support as a host capability model, not a separate user-facing mental model.

Done means: no background request can accidentally use the wrong host because it fell back to global state.

## 8. Sidebar And Project Host UX

- [x] Verify sidebar only shows host entries for projects that actually exist on those hosts.
- [x] Verify disconnected hosts are visually disabled and not selectable when selection would fail.
- [x] Keep local-only users in the low-jarring path: no unnecessary host chrome when only one local host exists.
- [x] Preserve workspace drag/reorder behavior and host-section drag behavior after project-first host changes.
- [x] Verify collapsed/expanded host behavior is stable while dragging.
- [x] Ensure host labels, counts, and status indicators are visually calm and aligned with docs/STYLEGUIDE.md.

Done means: the sidebar reflects project availability, not every configured SSH target, and disconnected states are understandable.

## 9. CLI, Remote Server, SSH, And Cloud-Ready Host APIs

- [x] Add CLI selectors for logical project, project host setup, source host/context, and run host.
- [x] Keep SSH and remote server behavior represented as host capabilities rather than separate product concepts.
- [x] Ensure remote server mode can still support users who want the desktop client to behave like “the server” when explicitly configured.
- [x] Ensure SSH remains the lightweight “execute on this machine over SSH” path.
- [~] Ensure remote server remains the durable runtime path for web/mobile handoff, background work, and richer server-owned state.
- [x] Note cloud VM provisioning as future host onboarding/provisioning work, not a requirement for this PR.

Done means: Local, SSH, remote server, and future cloud VMs share one Host model while keeping their different capabilities clear.

## 10. Verification Matrix

- [x] Unit-test source-context serialization, cache keys, and provider routing.
- [x] Unit-test automation migration from repo-id/path-based records.
- [x] Unit-test workspace creation selectors for logical project plus host setup.
- [x] Integration-test local project with local provider credentials.
- [x] Integration-test SSH project setup, clone/browse/create flows, and workspace creation.
- [x] Integration-test project available on local and SSH hosts, then create workspaces on each host.
- [x] Integration-test task source on Host A with workspace run on Host B.
- [ ] Integration-test two hosts with different GitHub accounts and verify issue/PR lists and mutations use the selected source.
- [ ] Integration-test GitLab where path-only selectors previously existed.
- [~] Integration-test Linear/Jira with explicit source account selection.
- [~] Integration-test automations on local host, SSH host, and remote server where supported.
- [~] Integration-test disconnected host UX for Tasks, New Workspace modal, sidebar, and automations.
- [ ] Integration-test new client with older remote server and older client with newer server where practical.
- [~] Electron-test Add Project flows: browse folder, clone URL, and create project from scratch on local and SSH hosts.
- [~] Electron-test workspace options and sidebar host filtering.
- [~] Electron-test Tasks source picker/display and task drawer mutations.
- [~] Capture screenshots for all important UX states in a dark-background HTML report.

Done means: the test report demonstrates the complete user journey, including local, SSH, multi-host project, task source, automation, disconnected, and version-skew states.

## 11. Documentation And PR Evidence

- [x] Update the main design doc with source context versus run host boundaries.
- [x] Update PR description with exact completed scope and explicit out-of-scope items.
- [x] Link this checklist from the PR or implementation notes.
- [x] Keep evidence screenshots out of git and attach/report them through approved PR channels.
- [ ] Add plain-English release note copy for the Host model only after UX is verified.

Done means: reviewers and future agents can understand the vision, implementation state, verification evidence, and remaining risk without reconstructing this conversation.

- [x] 2026-06-12: Added Automations run-target availability checks for manual runs, disabling/explaining Run Now when the project/workspace is missing, the saved run context no longer matches the host setup, the host is an unsupported runtime target, or the SSH host is disconnected/auth-needed/connecting; verified with focused availability tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Threaded repoId through hosted-review creation eligibility and creation so PR creation validates the exact project host setup instead of falling back to path-only repo lookup; added a main-process repoId/path mismatch regression and verified hosted-review IPC/store tests plus full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added Linear/Jira Settings account-scope diagnostics showing whether provider credentials and account checks are owned by the local desktop client or the selected remote server; verified with provider account-scope tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added repo-backed Tasks empty-state copy that distinguishes missing project sources from no matching GitHub/GitLab work, then verified with focused empty-state tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Scoped Jira Tasks drawer/list cache reconciliation by Jira task source context and site id so same-key issues from different hosts/accounts cannot replace each other; verified with focused cache selector tests, targeted oxlint, and full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Seeded New Workspace run-target selection from the incoming task source context so Linear/Jira starts preselect the logical project/source host instead of the ambient active repo; verified with a focused composer host-boundary test, targeted oxlint, and full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added explicit disabled-reason copy for external automation actions when an SSH host is disconnected/connecting, another action is in flight, or the local/remote automation source tool is missing; verified with focused availability tests, targeted oxlint, git diff --check, and full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added Tasks source-host availability for remote servers that are still loading capabilities or lack task-source-context.v1, so older servers degrade with explicit update/checking copy instead of looking connected-but-empty; verified with focused TaskPage/source-summary tests, targeted oxlint, git diff --check, and full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Updated the Automations UI save path to persist WorkspaceRunContext for created/edited Orca automations while keeping legacy projectId as repo-id compatibility data; verified with focused run-context tests, targeted oxlint, git diff --check, and full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Fed Tasks source-context diagnostics from the shared execution-host registry so the source chip now reports SSH availability and blocked/incompatible remote-server hosts; verified with summary tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Extended Linear/Jira Tasks source diagnostics to include the account-owning host plus blocked remote-server availability, keeping account source separate from workspace run host; verified with summary tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Started the user-facing Host copy audit by replacing stale “remote project” and “Remote SSH” UI labels with project-on-host / SSH-host language; verified with web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Re-ran the broader focused host-context suite covering source summaries, empty states, execution-host registry, project-host setup options/combobox, settings setup options, and automation target availability; 7 files / 34 tests passed plus full pnpm run typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added a safer automatic Tasks repo default that selects one source per logical GitHub project, preferring local when the same project exists on multiple hosts while preserving explicit/manual multi-host selection; verified with default-selection tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Fixed logical project projection for legacy repos whose GitHub `upstream` was missing by using repo-icon GitHub slug metadata as a provider-identity fallback; verified with `project-host-setup-projection.test.ts`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Repaired worktree discovery/backfill so existing workspace metadata upgrades from legacy repo-scoped project IDs to provider-backed logical project IDs when the project-host setup is the same, including SSH metadata fallback rows while preserving cached display/activity/sparse metadata; verified with `worktrees.test.ts` and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Re-verified the live Electron/SSH scenario after relaunch: one logical GitHub project has local and SSH project-host setups, stale SSH main-worktree metadata repairs to `github:stablyai/orca`, a workspace can be created on SSH, and another workspace can be created on Local Mac from the same project; screenshots saved under `notes/artifacts/`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Verified disconnected SSH metadata fallback in Electron: SSH worktrees remain visible from persisted metadata with repaired logical project ownership, the status area reports `SSH Disconnected`, the user sees a reconnect dialog, and project create controls are disabled while disconnected; screenshot saved under `notes/artifacts/host-context-disconnected-ssh-metadata-fallback.png`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Verified Add Project on SSH through the real Electron UI: selected an SSH host once, confirmed browse/clone/create screens do not show a redundant SSH-target field, cloned a throwaway Git repo into `/home/orca/add-project-clones`, and created a new Git project in `/home/orca/add-project-created`; verified remote filesystem and Orca project-host setup state.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Cleaned Add Project copy from stale “server folder/filesystem/path” wording to host-language where the UI applies to SSH, remote server, and future cloud hosts; verified with focused AddRepo tests, typecheck, and live screenshot `notes/artifacts/host-context-add-project-ssh-create-screen-host-copy.png`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Refreshed `notes/multihost-remote-verification-report.html` with the current dark-background evidence set for logical project repair, New Workspace host selection, disconnected SSH fallback, SSH clone, SSH create project, and sidebar state after Add Project flows.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Fixed Tasks React maximum-depth crashes by making repo-owner runtime settings selectors shallow-stable and preventing same-key GitHub slug metadata hooks from writing no-op cached/loading state; verified with a focused hook regression, `repo-runtime-owner.test.ts`, full typecheck, and live Electron Tasks rendering.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Fixed New Workspace `Run on` switching so changing project-host setup inside the same logical project preserves the selected GitHub/GitLab task source instead of degrading to plain text; verified live by starting from GitHub issue `#5200`, switching run host from Local Mac to SSH, and confirming the issue card remained selected.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Created a task-started SSH workspace from the live Tasks page at `/home/orca/task-ssh-source-local-163115`; verified the remote worktree exists and the sidebar shows `Linked issue #5200`, with screenshots added to `notes/multihost-remote-verification-report.html`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Verified Automations with SSH connected but Hermes unavailable on the remote PATH; changed the UI from misleading `Connect SSH` copy to `Source unavailable` plus `Retry source`, and captured the corrected state in the dark-background report.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Verified repo-backed Tasks empty-state copy for no selected project sources with `task-page-empty-state.test.ts`, covering the user-facing fallback when no host/account source is available for GitHub/GitLab work.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Updated `notes/project-first-host-model.md` with the explicit `TaskSourceContext` versus `WorkspaceRunContext` boundary, current task/automation implementation status, and remaining verification gaps; this checklist remains the detailed implementation tracker linked from the design-doc evidence set.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Continued the Host copy audit by replacing the remaining English Add Project/sidebar “remote project” and “Remote SSH” labels with project-on-SSH-host / SSH-host wording, then verified focused Add Project tests and full `pnpm run typecheck`; non-English locale placeholders still need the normal localization bootstrap pass.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Re-verified the New Workspace run-host path only exposes ready project-host setups, so hosts where the project does not exist are not selectable from workspace creation; covered by `ProjectHostSetupCombobox`, `project-host-setup-options`, and `project-host-workspace-target` tests.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Re-ran focused sidebar host tests: host headers are suppressed when only one host has visible workspaces, registered-but-empty/disconnected hosts do not create sidebar sections, SSH connection status flows to host headers, and drag mode can temporarily collapse host sections without mutating persisted collapse state; 8 sidebar files / 146 tests passed.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Tightened Add Project host selection so disconnected/error/blocked hosts stay visible but disabled instead of being selectable; verified with focused Add Project host selector/start tests and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added `CreateFromPicker` host-routing regression coverage for Automations branch/base-ref lookup, proving runtime-owned repos query their owner runtime and explicit local repos stay local even when another runtime is focused; verified alongside persistence and automation service tests.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Tightened the project-first design doc so host-aware Add Project is the current path for browse/import, clone, and create, while bulk setup and cloud VM provisioning are future host-onboarding work. Re-verified shared host-model tests covering local/SSH/runtime host kinds, runtime capability gating, SSH reconnect/disconnect actions, host settings overrides, and task source host scopes.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Tightened runtime project-host setup availability so remote servers must advertise both `project-host-setup.v1` and `workspace-run-context.v1` before users can choose them for project setup/workspace creation; verified with focused setup option tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Verified Linear Tasks in the live Electron app with the connected legacy Linear API-key workspace: the visible Linear list rendered 36 issues, source-scoped cache keys included both the legacy local account key and an explicit `linear:local:...` task-source cache key, and screenshot evidence was added to the dark verification report. Jira remains unverified because this profile has no connected Jira account.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Added Automations detail source-context display so saved automations show their provider source/account/host separately from run location; verified with focused source-display tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Closed code-level remote-server capability negotiation coverage: runtime status reports protocol/capability aliases; Settings summarizes missing Host-model capabilities; Tasks gates `task-source-context.v1`; project setup/workspace setup gates `project-host-setup.v1` plus `workspace-run-context.v1`; Add Project and sidebar surface version-skewed runtime hosts. Verified with 9 focused renderer/shared capability tests and the targeted runtime status test. Full `orca-runtime.test.ts` still has an unrelated headless tab focus-jump failure, so the separate old/new server integration row remains open.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Live-verified Add Project create-new-project on Local Mac through the visible Electron flow: Local Mac stayed selected as the Host, the create screen used `/Users/jinwoohong/orca/projects/host-context-local-created-0613`, the create action initialized a Git repo, the sidebar activated the new main workspace, and the store recorded a ready local project-host setup. Screenshots were added to the dark verification report.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Scoped Linear Teams/Projects/Views cached reads to the explicit Linear task source context so cached account-level Linear data cannot be borrowed from another host/account while focused runtime changes. Verified with focused Linear slice tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Live-verified Add Project disconnected-host UX in Electron by simulating the SSH target as disconnected in renderer state: the Host picker defaulted to Local Mac and showed the SSH host as a disabled muted row; restored SSH to connected and added screenshot evidence to `notes/multihost-remote-verification-report.html`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Audited Settings ownership for Source Control AI defaults, repository Source Control AI overrides, agent launch defaults, quick commands, workspace directories, and provider accounts; added a tested settings-ownership helper and surfaced the ownership language in Settings while preserving the existing Windows/WSL account and agent-location pattern. Verified with focused settings tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Improved remote-server Settings version-skew diagnostics by showing the exact compatibility explanation plus named runtime capabilities instead of only a capability count; verified with `RuntimeEnvironmentsPane` tests and web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Polished sidebar host headers from card-like rows into quieter sidebar grouping rows while keeping explicit SSH/status/count text; verified with focused sidebar tests, web typecheck, and live Electron screenshot `notes/artifacts/host-context-sidebar-calm-host-headers.png`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added a narrow `.gitignore` rule for `notes/artifacts/` so verification screenshots stay local while the HTML report can reference them; verified with `git check-ignore`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added `taskSourceContext` and `workspaceRunContext` to retryable pending worktree creation requests, seeded them from the Composer's selected task source and project-host setup, and verified the pending store preserves both identities with focused worktree tests plus web typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Preserved Jira task detail source context in Tasks open payloads, back/forward history entries, and replay state so a reopened Jira issue does not fall back to the ambient site/host; added a same-issue/different-source-host history regression and verified focused UI/history/feature-interaction tests, oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Scoped Jira optimistic detail patches to the selected `TaskSourceContext` so a same-key issue cached from another Jira host/site is not visually mutated; verified with `jira.test.ts`, focused oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Updated Composer GitHub PR and GitLab MR base-resolution to run against the selected workspace run repo instead of the provider item's source repo, preserving task source identity separately from run-host git commands; verified with a host-context boundary test, focused oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added Jira provider-depth interaction recording when starting workspace creation from a Jira issue, matching GitHub/GitLab/Linear task-provider behavior; verified with the feature-interaction writer-boundary test and focused oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Scoped Linear optimistic issue patches to the selected `TaskSourceContext` so same-id issues cached from another Linear host/workspace are not visually mutated; threaded source context through Linear drawer/project edits and verified with `linear.test.ts`, focused oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Scoped GitHub optimistic work-item patches to the selected `TaskSourceContext` so identical repo/item ids from another GitHub host/account are not visually mutated; threaded source context through Tasks row edits and GitHub item drawer edits, then verified with `github.test.ts`, focused oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Threaded GitHub Tasks row-level mutations through `TaskSourceContext` for issue state, assignees, reviewer requests/removals, PR merge/auto-merge, and new issue creation/follow-up reads; verified with focused GitHub/TaskPage tests, focused oxlint, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added provider account-scope diagnostics to GitHub/GitLab CLI integration cards so code-host credential checks show whether they belong to the local desktop client or selected remote server, matching the existing Linear/Jira ownership copy; verified with focused integration-card scope tests and oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Extended task-detail navigation state to GitLab and fixed Linear replay so saved `TaskSourceContext` is restored through back/forward and direct detail reopens; GitLab detail history keys now include source scope so identical MRs from different hosts stay distinct. Verified with focused UI/history/static-boundary tests and oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added host-scoped budget diagnostics to the GitHub and GitLab API Budget settings panels so rate-limit views explicitly say whether they are fetched from the local desktop CLI or selected remote-server CLI; verified with focused provider scope/panel render tests and oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Updated PR #5071 with the current verified scope, evidence docs, validation commands, explicit out-of-scope cloud/onboarding items, and remaining provider/version-skew risk.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added load-time backfill for legacy automations and automation runs that predate `runContext`/`sourceContext`, deriving explicit project host and provider source contexts from the saved repo id/path; verified with focused persistence migration coverage, automation service/precheck tests, daemon/settings merge-repair tests, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Repaired the merge-repair lint gate without disabling max-lines by extracting automation run-target/usage modules and settings subcomponents, fixed stale source-context hook dependencies, and tightened GitHub PR checks cache ownership so `noCache` bypasses cache/in-flight requests while head-specific checks are reused during refresh events; verified targeted oxlint, focused automation/settings/GitHub cache tests (10 files / 157 tests), `github-checks-cache.test.ts`, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Preserved the explicit remote-server focus path as Settings → Active Server, with copy explaining that selecting a saved server makes it the default Host for server-routed projects, files, terminals, provider accounts, and browser/mobile handoff rather than introducing a separate Focused Host Mode; verified with `RuntimeEnvironmentsPane.test.ts`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added persisted context migration notes to `notes/project-first-host-model.md` covering old automations/runs, legacy `Automation.projectId`, cached task selections, retryable pending workspace creation requests, and task drawer/navigation replay state.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Completed source-context unit coverage by adding GitLab/Linear/Jira provider identity cache-scope serialization tests and rerunning shared source-context, GitHub source/cache routing, UI open-task, and task-navigation history suites (6 files / 261 tests) plus targeted oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Reconciled Add Project host-selection tests with the disabled-host UX: disconnected SSH hosts and blocked runtime hosts remain visible but disabled, the hook falls back to Local Mac instead of selecting a disconnected SSH host, and selection handlers ignore unavailable hosts; verified Add Project host selector/selection/dialog, sidebar host options, and execution-host registry tests (5 files / 34 tests) plus targeted oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Re-verified project-first drag/reorder behavior across workspace manual order, drag units, workspace-board pointer drops, host-section order/rows, repo reorder host splitting, and project-header drag helpers; 9 files / 62 tests passed plus targeted oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Routed Linear and Jira Tasks reads, create flows, list/detail mutations, comments, metadata, and New Workspace handoff through explicit account-backed `TaskSourceContext` while preserving legacy focused-runtime cache keys for old callers; verified with Linear/Jira source-routing regressions, focused Linear/Jira slice tests (2 files / 48 tests), targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Preserved Linear task detail source context in `openTaskPage` data, back/forward history entries, history de-dupe keys, and Linear warm prefetch so direct detail opens replay the same account/host source instead of recomputing from focused settings; verified with UI/history tests (2 files / 131 tests) and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Scoped GitHub Tasks partial-failure retry ownership to the selected source cache scope instead of `repoPath`, so same-project/same-path multi-host failures cannot make the wrong source banner look in-flight; verified with `task-page-cache-selectors.test.ts`, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Routed GitHub issue reads, PR check reads/details, PR comments, review replies, and review-thread resolution through explicit `TaskSourceContext` in the store/preload/main IPC boundary, and source-scoped their comment/check caches; verified with GitHub slice regressions (106 tests), focused oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Guarded remaining GitLab path-only fallbacks by making `workItemByPath` use the same repoId/source-context selector as the rest of GitLab IPC, passing repoId from URL picker and right-sidebar GitLab review actions, and verifying source-host routing with GitLab IPC regressions plus focused oxlint and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Guarded GitHub label and assignable-user metadata lookups with the same repo/source-context selector as task mutations, so drawer edit metadata cannot bypass source-host validation; verified with GitHub IPC regressions (17 tests), focused oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Continued the Host copy audit through onboarding, remote folder-add, attachment import, Settings SSH copy, and remote file browser catalog text; extracted `RepoStepNestedImportPanel` to keep the touched onboarding component under max-lines, and verified with stale-copy scans, focused onboarding/repos tests, focused oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Preserved explicit automation run-host context in CLI project selectors: `orca automations create/edit --project/--host` and `--project-host-setup` now send `WorkspaceRunContext` alongside the legacy repo selector, so scheduled runs retain logical project, host, setup, repo, and path identity. Verified with focused CLI regressions (108 tests), targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added an advanced automation CLI source selector via `--source-context <json|null>` for create/edit, normalizing the shared `TaskSourceContext` shape before RPC and allowing edit callers to clear the source context with `null`; verified with focused CLI regressions (111 tests), targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added a reusable Tasks source availability notice and wired unavailable source-host/account states into the Tasks source chrome, so disconnected/auth-needed/blocked hosts show an inline status, fully unavailable sources disable their icon, and partial multi-host failures remain selectable with warning copy; verified with focused source-summary tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added explicit remote-runtime Host model capability names for project setup, task source context, and workspace run context, then surfaced a Settings saved-server summary that says whether Host model support is ready, unknown, or requires a server update for specific missing capabilities; verified with focused RuntimeEnvironmentsPane tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Continued the Host copy audit by replacing the SSH disconnected dialog's stale "remote repository" message with SSH-host wording; verified with a stale-copy scan, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Improved the Tasks project/source picker by removing the repo-row `SSH` tag and showing host-aware project detail (`Host · path`) when the picker is fed host context, so same-project-on-multiple-hosts is distinguishable without implying the project itself is SSH; verified with focused combobox tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked the default Tasks multi-host behavior complete based on the existing implementation that selects one source per logical GitHub project, prefers Local Mac for duplicate logical projects, and preserves manual multi-host selection; evidence is `task-page-default-repo-selection.test.ts` plus the prior full typecheck.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Made provider settings and API-budget scope copy point users to Settings > Active Server when they need to edit or inspect another Host's provider credentials/budgets, keeping the existing global Host selector discoverable without duplicating a per-card selector; verified with provider-scope, source-control card, tracker card, and rate-limit panel tests.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Added a TaskPage boundary regression proving source-provider switching updates only task source/default task source and does not mutate focused runtime, project-host setup, or workspace run context; this completes the task-source versus run-host switching row alongside the existing Composer host-context boundary tests.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked provider task-source diagnostics complete based on the Tasks source summary/picker implementation that names provider, host, repo/project identity, Linear workspace, Jira site, and unavailable source-host state; verified with source-summary and combobox tests.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked task drawer source-context persistence complete based on UI slice coverage that records GitHub, GitLab, Linear, and Jira task-detail history entries with their exact `TaskSourceContext`, plus direct-open prefetch coverage for source-scoped GitHub and Linear reads.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked PR/MR base resolution complete based on `useComposerState-host-context-boundaries.test.ts`, which asserts GitHub PR and GitLab MR base lookup uses the selected run repo instead of the provider item's source repo while preserving source item metadata separately.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Extracted and tested external automation source availability copy so local missing tooling, disconnected SSH sources, connecting SSH sources, and connected SSH hosts with missing remote tooling get distinct states; verified with focused automation availability tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked repo-id/path compatibility adapters complete after hardening the renderer project-host selector to merge repo-derived compatibility rows when hydrated project/setup arrays are empty or partial, alongside existing shared projection, persistence backfill/sync, automation context migration, and pending worktree context coverage. Verified with selector/projection tests, persistence tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Marked the Host copy audit complete after replacing remaining visible stale SSH/project wording in paired-web project creation errors, Settings SSH search entries, AI Vault SSH-host workspace copy, and SSH shutdown errors. Verified with a stale-copy scan showing only comments/tests/technical internals, focused SSH IPC tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Completed Settings ownership/account rows by adding a shared provider Host scope control with a Change Host action that opens Settings > Active Server from GitHub/GitLab/Linear/Jira account surfaces and GitHub/GitLab API budget panels. Existing ownership diagnostics still distinguish desktop-client versus remote-server credentials, and rate-limit panels show the budget Host scope. Verified with settings ownership, RuntimeEnvironmentsPane, provider account, source-control card, task-tracker card, Jira card, and rate-limit panel tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Completed Tasks account/host metadata by showing repo-backed account labels in source summaries when GitHub/GitLab accounts differ by Host, while preserving host labels, provider identities, Linear workspace names, Jira site names, and unavailable-host status in labels/titles. Verified with source-summary and repo picker tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Continued the automation project-id migration by changing CLI automation show output to foreground explicit `runContext` fields (`runProjectId`, `runHostId`, `projectHostSetupId`, `runRepoId`, `runPath`) and label the old repo id as `legacyRepoId`. The checklist row remains partial because the shared `Automation.projectId` compatibility field still exists. Verified with CLI format/index tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Aligned Automations manual-run disabled states with the backend run-target resolver so saved run contexts now disable Run Now when the project-host setup is missing or not ready, instead of failing after dispatch. Verified with focused automation availability tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-12: Routed GitHub drawer label/assignee/reviewer metadata reads through the same task source context as issue/PR mutations, including slug-addressed Project view rows and reviewer request/remove actions, so same-repo multi-host drawers do not fall back to the repo owner or focused runtime. Verified with a focused source-boundary test, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Tightened runtime project-host setup mutations so older remote servers that advertise `project-host-setup.v1` but not `workspace-run-context.v1` are blocked before setup/clone/create/update/delete RPCs mutate server state; read-only hydration still degrades to repo-derived compatibility rows. Verified with focused repo capability tests, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed the full-page Pull Request metadata popovers and mention suggestions through the PR repo owner host instead of ambient focused runtime state, so reviewer, label, assignee, and comment-composer reads align with the existing repo-owned mutation routing. Verified with a focused PR host-boundary test, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed GitHub Project view field edits, slug-only row edits, issue-type lookups, label/assignee pickers, and slug dialog detail reads through the Project view source host instead of the ambient focused runtime when no registered repo owner is available. Verified with GitHub slice source-routing regressions, targeted oxlint, full `pnpm run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Replaced the generic remote-server Automation manual-run block with explicit checking, disconnected/unreachable, graph-not-ready, and update-required disabled states derived from saved runtime status before the current unsupported manual-run fallback. Verified with focused automation availability tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Guarded backend automation ownership for runtime-host repos: newly saved/updated runtime-owned automations now record `remote_host_service`, and main-process dispatch resolution skips runtime targets before desktop renderer dispatch until durable remote scheduling exists. Verified with persistence and automation service regressions, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Preserved exact GitLab provider identity for item-specific Tasks flows by threading `GitLabWorkItem.projectRef` into the task source context used for detail pages and Start Workspace handoff. Verified with TaskPage source-boundary regression, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Removed the redundant locked SSH target row from the Add Project remote-path step after the host has already been selected, while preserving a compact reconnect action for disconnected locked hosts. Fresh Electron validation connected a Docker SSH target through Orca's relay IPC, added `/home/orca/host-context-e2e-local` via Add Project, and created a remote SSH worktree at `/home/orca/goldfish`; screenshots were added to the dark-background report. Verified with focused Add Project tests, targeted oxlint, and remote filesystem checks.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Extended Tasks source availability reasons so missing provider auth, unavailable source tooling, and unsupported providers can surface as distinct source-host states instead of generic connection/version failures. The checklist row remains partial until runtime/provider preflight feeds these reasons end to end. Verified with focused source-summary tests and targeted oxlint.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Fed desktop-owned GitHub/GitLab preflight into Tasks source availability for local and SSH project sources, so missing `gh`/`glab` or missing CLI auth disables the affected provider with source-tool/auth-specific copy. Runtime-owned sources intentionally skip desktop preflight and continue to rely on runtime capability/fetch ownership. Verified with provider availability tests, Tasks source summary tests, TaskPage source-boundary tests, targeted oxlint, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Electron-verified a local project with local GitHub credentials: added the local Orca worktree to the running dev app, confirmed `gh` auth for `Jinwoo-H`, fetched 10 GitHub work items through explicit `TaskSourceContext { provider: github, hostId: local }`, verified the local source-scoped cache key, and captured the rendered Tasks page showing GitHub issues for the local project.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Snapshotted Source Control PR-generation runtime ownership and reused that owner for generation, cancellation, and post-generation git refresh, preventing async PR generation from following a later focused-host switch. Verified with focused Source Control host-boundary tests, targeted oxlint, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Extended Source Control git remote operations and upstream refresh to accept explicit runtime-owner settings, then wired SourceControl and ChecksPanel to pass the repo owner host for push, pull, fetch, sync, fast-forward, rebase, publish, and PR-generation follow-up refreshes. Verified with focused editor/git-status tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed Delete Workspace dirty-state preloads through the selected worktree runtime owner instead of ambient focused settings, so delete warnings inspect the host that owns the workspace. Verified with focused DeleteWorktreeDialog host-boundary tests, existing worktree-owner tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed editor file-drop stat/import operations through the selected worktree runtime owner instead of ambient focused settings, so local, SSH, and runtime workspace drops use the host that owns the workspace. Verified with focused file-drop owner tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed agent draft-paste readiness probes and paste writes through the tab's worktree runtime owner when available, covering legacy remote PTY ids that do not embed their runtime owner. Verified with focused agent-paste tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed File Explorer directory reads, stat/import/create/move/duplicate operations, ignored-file checks, and background git/conflict polling through the selected worktree runtime owner instead of ambient focused settings. Verified with focused right-sidebar boundary/projection/polling/drag tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Fed runtime-owned GitHub/GitLab preflight into Tasks source availability by checking each available, task-source-capable runtime host with `preflight.check` and applying that host's `gh`/`glab` auth/tool status to only its own task sources. Verified with provider availability tests, TaskPage source-boundary tests, source-summary tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Fed saved automation source contexts into Run Now availability so internal Orca automations now disable before dispatch when the saved source host is unavailable, still checking capabilities, missing task-source support, missing GitHub/GitLab auth, or missing provider tooling. Verified with focused automation availability tests, provider availability tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Closed another request/cache ownership slice by routing right-sidebar search, create-review field generation, browser tab default profile selection, Smart Workspace GitHub/GitLab/Linear lookups, GitHub Project browse cache, Project slug comments, and standalone GitHub issue comments through explicit worktree/repo/source ownership instead of ambient focused runtime state. Verified with focused ownership/browser/smart-submit tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed Quick Open file listing through the selected worktree runtime owner instead of ambient focused settings, matching File Explorer and sidebar search ownership. Verified with focused Quick Open and file-owner boundary tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Routed typed GitHub issue/PR lookup entry points in Cmd-J, Smart Workspace cross-repo accept, and Composer submit fallback through source-aware local/SSH/runtime lookup helpers instead of direct preload calls. Verified with focused composer/palette/smart-submit tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [x] 2026-06-13: Centralized Automation run identity so renderer dispatch, Automations UI, main-process run-target resolution, persistence backfill, and CLI formatting resolve `runRepoId` through explicit `runContext` with a named `legacyRepoId` fallback instead of each caller reading the persisted compatibility field directly. The checklist row remains partial because `Automation.projectId` still exists for storage compatibility. Verified with shared identity, automation run-context, automation service, and CLI format tests, targeted oxlint, `git diff --check`, and full `pnpm run typecheck`.
- [~] 2026-06-13: Remaining source-error gap: unavailable hosts, version-skewed runtimes, and GitHub/GitLab missing auth/tooling are surfaced for desktop-owned and runtime-owned source hosts, but unsupported-provider still has no production emitter per source host.
- [~] 2026-06-13: Remaining Automation gap: run-host/source-host availability and missing project-host setup are handled for manual/internal/external actions, but `Automation.projectId` remains the legacy repo-id compatibility field.
