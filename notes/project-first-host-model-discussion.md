# Project-First Host Model Discussion

## Purpose

This note captures the VM / SSH / remote-server discussion so far and turns it
into a concrete implementation inventory.

The question we are answering is:

Should Orca make machines the outermost organizing object, or should projects
remain the outermost object and machines become places where those projects can
run?

## TL;DR

The durable model should be:

```text
Project -> ProjectHostSetup -> Workspace
```

There are **12 major change surfaces** required to fully fit this model.

Some pieces are already partially implemented on this branch. The model is not
complete until creation, setup, settings, sidebar behavior, runtime routing,
cache ownership, compatibility, CLI/API, SSH, and Electron validation all speak
the same project-first language.

## Current Versus Desired Model

The earlier multi-host direction made hosts more visible:

```text
Host
  Project
    Workspace
```

That is useful for operational awareness. It helps answer:

- which hosts exist
- which hosts are online or disconnected
- where workspaces are running
- which SSH or remote machine might be causing a problem

But as the default durable mental model, host-first can make Orca feel like the
user is switching between isolated machine silos.

The desired long-term model is:

```text
Project
  Host setup
    Workspace
```

In plain English: a host is where a project can run. It should not usually be
the object that owns the user's project.

## Core Concepts

### Project

A `Project` is the durable repo/project identity the user recognizes.

Examples:

- Orca
- a Linux-only CUDA project
- a work repo available only on a company machine
- a personal repo available on a local Mac and an SSH server

### Host

A `Host` is a place where code can run.

Examples:

- local Mac
- SSH target
- remote server
- VM
- future Orca-provisioned cloud VM
- remote Orca runtime

For now, "VM" is a loose product term. It can be modeled as a host with extra
capabilities, provisioning metadata, and eventually billing metadata.

### ProjectHostSetup

A `ProjectHostSetup` means:

```text
this project is available on this host at this path with this setup state
```

This is where host-local facts belong:

- checkout path
- worktree base path
- setup status
- setup scripts
- host-specific project settings
- platform constraints
- project availability on a host

### Workspace

A `Workspace` is a branch/task/worktree running from one project setup on one
host.

A workspace should eventually know:

- `projectId`
- `hostId`
- `projectHostSetupId`
- host-local worktree path

## Why Project-First Is Better

Users usually think:

```text
I am working on Project A.
Where should this workspace run?
```

They do not usually think:

```text
I am inside Machine B.
Which unrelated copy of Project A is here?
```

Project-first also handles the hard cases cleanly:

- project exists only locally
- project exists only on a remote Linux server
- project exists on both local and remote hosts
- project requires GPU hardware
- project is work-only and should only appear on a work host
- project is platform-specific
- future cloud VM is just another host setup option

## Sidebar Direction

The default sidebar should trend project-first.

For a single-host project, avoid noisy host nesting:

```text
Orca
  feature-a
  feature-b
```

For a multi-host project, host context should appear only where it helps:

```text
Orca
  Local Mac
    feature-a
  openclaw 2
    fix-ssh-agent-status
```

Host-first grouping still has value as an operational view or filter. It is good
for troubleshooting and status visibility, but it should not be the only durable
organization model.

### Disconnected Or Hidden Hosts

Configured SSH targets are not the same as project availability.

Recommended behavior:

- show a disconnected host when it has relevant project setup history or
  workspaces
- do not show a never-used SSH target in the project sidebar just because it is
  configured
- keep host connection management in host/settings surfaces
- use clear disconnected wording and actions instead of relying only on a gray
  dot

## Workspace Creation Direction

Creating a workspace should eventually ask:

1. Which project?
2. Which host should run it?
3. What branch/task/workspace name?

If the project is not available on the selected host, Orca should offer:

- clone project to that host
- import an existing folder on that host
- select a different host

The user should not have to know about compatibility repo ids.

## Project Setup Direction

"Add project" and "make this project available on another host" are related but
separate actions.

Important flows:

- import a local folder as a new project
- import an SSH folder as a new project
- set up an existing project on another host
- clone an existing project onto a selected host
- when adding a new host, optionally initialize one or more projects there
- later, provision an Orca cloud VM and materialize selected projects there

## Settings Direction

Settings need explicit ownership.

| Setting type | Owner | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client setting | desktop client | theme, local UI preferences |
| Host setting | machine/runtime | SSH connection, display name, health, server version |
| Project setting | durable project | project name, provider identity |
| Project-host setup setting | project on one host | checkout path, worktree base path, setup script |

A host dropdown or host table inside project settings is probably sufficient for
host-specific project settings, similar to existing Windows/WSL-specific
settings patterns.

## Version Skew

Remote servers may not match the desktop client version.

The model needs capability checks so a new client can talk to an old server
without pretending unsupported features exist.

The UI should disable setup/create actions with concrete reasons:

- host is offline
- server version does not support project-host setup APIs
- project is not set up on this host
- selected host does not support required platform/capability
- required agent/runtime is unavailable

Old client / new server should continue to work through repo/worktree
compatibility APIs where possible.

## Reference Comparison

### Superset

Superset is the closer reference for Orca's desired data model.

Its conceptual model is:

```text
Project + Host -> Workspace
```

Useful lessons for Orca:

- project identity is durable
- a host is where the project can be materialized
- workspace creation targets both project and host
- a project can be set up on multiple hosts
- if a project is not available on a host, creation can block and offer setup
- project settings can contain host-specific path/worktree settings

This maps well to Orca because Orca already has durable repos/projects,
worktrees, agents, terminals, source control, and host-aware runtimes.

### Cmux

Cmux is more session/workspace-first.

Its conceptual model is closer to:

```text
Workspace/session -> local or remote execution context
```

Useful lessons for Orca:

- SSH should feel first class
- remote terminals, file views, browser panes, and localhost routing should
  follow the remote execution context
- reconnect and persistence behavior matter
- remote/session polish matters even if the data model differs

Cmux is useful as an SSH/session polish reference. It is not the best reference
for Orca's durable project/setup data model because it does not appear to center
"this project is available on these hosts" as the primary abstraction.

## What Needs To Change

There are **12 major change surfaces**.

### 1. Shared Data Model

Current `Repo` mixes durable project identity with host-local checkout details.
The new model needs first-class project/setup concepts.

Needs:

- `Project`
- `Host`
- `ProjectHostSetup`
- explicit workspace ownership by `projectId`, `hostId`, and
  `projectHostSetupId`
- compatibility projection from old repo-shaped records

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 2. Persistence And Migration

Existing users need a boring migration.

Needs:

- derive one project per reliable durable identity
- derive one setup per existing repo checkout
- avoid merging same-name folders unless provider identity is reliable
- preserve old ids or aliases where compatibility requires it
- backfill existing workspaces with project/setup ownership when safe

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 3. Runtime And Request Ownership

The UI can be project-first, but execution still happens on a host.

Needs:

- route terminals, agents, filesystem, browser, source control, hooks, and
  automations through the workspace's owning host
- avoid using the currently focused host as a hidden global default for
  workspace-owned operations
- scope cancellation and stale-response handling to the host/setup that owns the
  request

Current branch status: partially implemented by multi-host groundwork; still
needs a project/setup audit.

### 4. Workspace Creation

Creation must target a project and host, not only a repo id.

Needs:

- project picker
- run-on host picker
- unavailable-host reasons
- inline clone/import setup actions
- compatibility resolver from `{ projectId, hostId }` to current repo/setup
  internals while old APIs remain

Current branch status: partially implemented. Ready project-host setups can be
selected from the composer `Run on` menu, and known hosts that still need setup
now appear as setup-target rows instead of being invisible. The composer can
import an existing folder for those hosts and then switch to the new ready
setup. Inline clone/provision actions for those rows are still missing.

### 5. Project Setup Flow

"Add repo" becomes a family of project/setup flows.

Needs:

- import existing folder on local host
- import existing folder over SSH
- clone project onto selected host
- set up an existing project on another host
- bulk setup when adding a new host
- future cloud provisioning hook

Current branch status: existing-folder setup is partially implemented. Clone,
provisioning, bulk setup, and setup for unknown/new hosts are not complete.

### 6. Sidebar Row Model

The sidebar should be built from projects, hosts, setups, and workspaces rather
than repo-only grouping.

Needs:

- project-first grouping
- host labels/subgroups only when useful
- host filters and online/offline status retained
- clear disconnected-host behavior
- drag/reorder rules for projects, host sections, and workspaces

Current branch status: project grouping exists for durable project/setup
identity, and the default all-host Projects sidebar now keeps project grouping
outermost. Host headers remain for explicit host visibility filters and
operational grouping modes. Mixed-host project groups now show first-pass host
context badges on workspace cards, while single-host project groups omit them.
Electron validation and disconnected-host polish remain.

### 7. Project Settings

Project settings need a global area plus host-specific setup sections.

Needs:

- project-global settings
- host-specific paths, worktree paths, setup scripts, and platform constraints
- host dropdown/table inside settings
- provider-neutral source-control settings

Current branch status: in progress. Project settings include an available-hosts
table, setup-specific settings navigation, and an existing-folder import form.
The full ownership split is not complete.

### 8. Host Settings

Host settings should describe the machine/runtime, not duplicate every project
setting.

Needs:

- connection details
- display name
- health/status
- server version and protocol compatibility
- platform/capabilities
- host-wide defaults and overrides

Current branch status: multi-host settings groundwork exists; it still needs to
align cleanly with project-host setup settings.

### 9. Version And Capability Compatibility

New clients and old servers will coexist.

Needs:

- host capability probing
- fallback projection when project/setup APIs are missing
- disabled states with specific reasons
- structured errors for unsupported old-server actions
- old client / new server behavior that degrades safely

Current branch status: runtime compatibility exists; project/setup capability
gating needs to be layered on.

### 10. Caches And Local State

Some caches are project-global; many are host/setup-local.

Needs:

- classify caches as project, host, setup, or workspace scoped
- include host/setup ids in cache keys for refs, git status, filesystem state,
  capabilities, terminals, browser sessions, and remote results
- prevent a response from one host from overwriting another host's state for the
  same project

Current branch status: partially addressed for host partitioning; needs a
project/setup ownership audit.

### 11. CLI And API

External commands should speak project-first language.

Needs:

- `orca project list`
- `orca project setups`
- `orca project setup-existing-folder --project <id> --host <id> --path <path>`
- `orca worktree create --project <id> --host <id> ...`
- `orca worktree create --project-host-setup <id> ...`
- compatibility aliases for old repo/worktree commands
- structured availability errors

Current branch status: partially implemented.

### 12. Tests And Verification

This crosses storage, routing, UI, SSH, and compatibility.

Needs:

- migration tests
- selector/sidebar grouping tests
- create-workspace tests
- setup-on-host tests
- settings ownership tests
- SSH end-to-end validation
- version mismatch tests
- Electron validation for sidebar, creation, and settings

Current branch status: model/API tests exist; full end-to-end UI, SSH, and
version-skew validation remains.

## Implementation Status On This Branch

Already partially landed:

- shared `Project` and `ProjectHostSetup` types
- compatibility projection from existing `Repo[]`
- persisted compatibility fields for projects and project-host setups
- renderer hydration and fallback for older runtimes
- project-aware sidebar grouping in existing repo grouping paths
- default all-host Projects sidebar keeps projects outermost while preserving
  host-section operational views for explicit host filters
- first-pass host context badges for mixed-host project groups, without adding
  badge noise to single-host project groups
- project-host-aware workspace creation target resolver
- optional workspace metadata for `projectId`, `hostId`, and
  `projectHostSetupId`
- setup-existing-folder API plumbing through local IPC/preload/runtime paths
- project settings existing-folder setup form for known local, SSH, and active
  runtime hosts
- CLI commands for listing projects/setups and creating worktrees by
  project/setup
- composer `Run on` selector when a project has multiple ready setups
- setup-target `Run on` rows for known hosts where the selected project is not
  set up yet
- inline `Run on` import-existing-folder setup for known hosts where the
  selected project is not set up yet

Not complete yet:

- clone/provision flows
- inline clone/provision actions from the composer `Run on` menu
- bulk setup flows and setup for hosts that are not already known to the client
- full project settings split into global and host-specific ownership
- host settings/capability UI aligned with project setup
- complete cache/request ownership audit
- complete version-skew capability gating
- full Electron and SSH end-to-end validation

## Recommended Implementation Shape

Implement this as an additive migration.

1. Keep existing `Repo` APIs alive while adding project/setup records.
2. Use conservative identity matching so only reliably linked checkouts merge
   into one project.
3. Teach creation flows to resolve `{ projectId, hostId }` into a ready setup.
4. Add setup-on-host flows for local, SSH, runtime, and future cloud hosts.
5. Split settings into client, host, project, and project-host setup ownership.
6. Audit host-local caches and runtime routing.
7. Move visible default UX to project-first once behavior is real.
8. Preserve a host-first operational view/filter for troubleshooting.
9. Validate migration, creation, settings, sidebar, SSH, and version skew before
   calling the model complete.

## Final Position

Keep hosts visible, but do not make them the durable outermost object.

The durable model should be project-first because it matches how users think
about repo/worktree/task work, while still supporting SSH machines, VMs, remote
servers, and future cloud compute as first-class places where a project can run.
