// Why: defines the wire shape carried by the JSON-RPC `agent.hook` notification
// the relay sends to Orca. Consumed by `src/relay/agent-hook-server.ts` (which
// produces it after the shared listener parses an HTTP POST) and by
// `src/main/agent-hooks/server.ts` (which ingests it via `ingestRemote`).
//
// Lives in `shared/` because the relay deliberately has no Electron dependency
// (cf. `src/relay/protocol.ts` header). `agent-hook-types.ts` is reserved for
// the renderer-bound IPC + installer contract; this module is the wire envelope
// between Orca's main process and the remote relay.
//
// Per the design doc:
// - The relay normalizes; Orca routes. The envelope's `payload` field has
//   already been through `normalizeHookPayload` (which calls
//   `parseAgentStatusPayload` → `normalizeAgentStatusObject`) on the relay
//   side. Orca's `ingestRemote` re-runs the canonical payload normalizer at
//   the SSH trust boundary before caching or persisting, so relay skew or a
//   buggy remote process cannot poison main-process state.
// - The wire `connectionId` is **always `null`**: a `connectionId` is Orca's
//   local handle on an `ssh2` connection, not a wire identity. Orca stamps the
//   real value on receive from `mux` identity inside `ingestRemote`.
// - The wire `version` and `env` fields are forwarded from the agent CLI's
//   POST body so Orca's warn-once protocol diagnostics still fire. The relay
//   default env is `remote`, a location marker ignored by dev-vs-prod checks.

import type { ParsedAgentStatusPayload } from './agent-status-types'
import type { AgentProviderSessionMetadata } from './agent-session-resume'

// Why: the local hook server knows the discriminator from URL pathname routing
// (`/hook/<source>`); the relay equally must tag each forwarded notification
// with the same value so Orca can attribute the event back to the right CLI.
// Promoted from `src/main/agent-hooks/server.ts` so the relay can import it
// without dragging Electron in (the shared listener module is the only place
// that consumes it from the relay side).
