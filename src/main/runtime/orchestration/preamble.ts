  // must NOT pre-populate this with empty data; the drift section is a

// trailing prose, so rules must land at the point of use.

Your coordinator's terminal handle is: ${params.coordinatorHandle}

You talk to the coordinator only through the CLI commands below. Do not use
Slack, GitHub comments, or any other channel to reach a human during the run.

=== CLI COMMANDS ===

  # Report task completion (REQUIRED when done — even on failure).
  #
  # RULE: --body must be a 3-sentence executive summary (what you did,
  # what you found, what's left). Never send an empty body; the coordinator
  # reads the body first and only opens artifacts if it needs more detail.
  # If you produced a long-form artifact, include its path as
  # payload.reportPath so the coordinator can find it without a file search.
  #
  # RULE: send worker_done exactly once. Failure is still a worker_done
  # with subject like "Failed: <reason>" — never silently exit.
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload so a late completion
  # from a failed retry cannot complete the current dispatch.
  ${cli} orchestration send --to ${params.coordinatorHandle} \\
    --type worker_done --subject "<short status>" \\
    --body "<3-sentence summary: what you did, what you found, what's left>" \\
    --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} \\
    --files-modified "path/a,path/b" \\
    --report-path "<optional: path to the full artifact>"

  # BEHAVIOR RULE: send a heartbeat every ${HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MIN} minutes
  # while actively working on the task. The coordinator uses this to
  # distinguish "still thinking" from "hung / crashed." Skip heartbeats only
  # while blocked inside \`check --wait\` or \`ask\` — those calls are
  # themselves liveness signals.
  #
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload: the coordinator
  # attributes the heartbeat to the specific dispatch context, not just
  # the task, so a straggler heartbeat from a previously-failed dispatch
  # cannot mask a hung retry.
  ${cli} orchestration send --to ${params.coordinatorHandle} \\
    --type heartbeat --subject "alive" \\
    --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} \\
    --phase "<short: investigating|implementing|reviewing|waiting>"

  # Ask the coordinator a question and block until it answers.
  #
  # BEHAVIOR RULE #1 (MUST NOT VIOLATE):
  # NEVER use AskUserQuestion; use \`${cli} orchestration ask\` or send
  # --type decision_gate. AskUserQuestion opens a local TUI prompt that the
  # coordinator cannot see and cannot answer — your session will hang forever
  # waiting on a human. Every interactive question goes through \`ask\` below.
  #
  # The \`ask\` verb is a thin wrapper: it sends a decision_gate message and
  # blocks on \`check --wait\` until the coordinator replies, then prints the
  # reply body. Use it anywhere you would otherwise have reached for
  # AskUserQuestion.
  ${cli} orchestration ask --to ${params.coordinatorHandle} \\
    --question "<your question>" \\
    --options "<optional,comma,separated>" \\
    --timeout-ms 600000

  # Escalate a blocker or failure (pre-completion, when you need the
  # coordinator to do something before you can continue):
  ${cli} orchestration send --to ${params.coordinatorHandle} \\
    --type escalation --subject "Blocked: <reason>" \\
    --body "<details>" \\
    --task-id ${params.taskId}

  # Check for messages from the coordinator:
  ${cli} orchestration check

=== AFTER YOU SEND worker_done ===

Keep the shell session open for a grace period (10 minutes) in case the
coordinator sends a follow-up or re-dispatches you. Poll with
\`${cli} orchestration check\` every 2 minutes during that window. If no
follow-up arrives, you may exit after the grace period — the coordinator
will not expect further output from you.

If the coordinator re-dispatches you (you will receive a fresh preamble +
TASK block), reset your polling and start the new task. Do not respond
to the previous task's follow-ups after a re-dispatch.`

  // Why: the drift section fires only when the coordinator allowed dispatch
  // against a stale worktree (via `allow-stale-base: true` in the task spec,
  // see §3.4) OR when behind>0 but under the refusal threshold. Either way
  // it is defense-in-depth: the worker sees the drift from line 1 instead
  // of discovering it via stale line numbers in artifacts later.
  const drift =
    params.baseDrift && params.baseDrift.behind > 0 ? buildDriftSection(params.baseDrift) : ''
