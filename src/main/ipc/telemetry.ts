// IPC surface for the telemetry transport. Four handlers, all renderer-
// facing: one pipe (`telemetry:track`), one consent-mutation
// (`telemetry:setOptIn`), one silent-persist for the banner ✕ path
// (`telemetry:acknowledgeBanner`), and one read-only getter for effective
// consent state (`telemetry:getConsentState`, used by the Privacy pane to
// render env-var blocked-state helper text). Every track call from the
// renderer lands here and funnels into the same `track()` the main-
// originated events go through — the validator is the single enforcement
// point, not this file.
//
// Threat model: the renderer renders attacker-controllable content (agent
// output, MCP responses, file contents, markdown, diff views). An
// XSS-equivalent rendering bug in any of those surfaces gives an attacker
// the ability to invoke `window.api.telemetry*` at will. The handlers
// below are designed to fail closed under that model:
//
//   - Strict main-side type narrows. TypeScript types do not survive IPC
//     serialization; the renderer can pass anything across the wire, so we
//     narrow at the boundary. Non-string `name` or non-object `props` on
//     `track` → drop silently. Non-boolean `optedIn` on `setOptIn` → drop.
//   - Consent-mutation rate limit. A real user flips the Privacy pane
//     toggle a handful of times at most; beyond 5 per session it is either
//     a UI bug or a compromised renderer. Drop silently past the cap.
//     Applies to `acknowledgeBanner` as well — that path also mutates
//     persisted consent, so it lives under the same per-session ceiling.
//
// `via` derivation: the renderer does NOT pass `via` across the wire. That
// design was rejected specifically because a compromised renderer could
// misreport `via`, muddying the one signal we use to distinguish
// first-launch interactions from settings flips. Main derives `via` from
// fields main already owns (`existedBeforeTelemetryRelease`, current
// `optedIn`) before any state mutation. The two product paths map cleanly
// to the two schema values (`first_launch_banner` for the existing-user
// notice's "Turn off" button; `settings` for everything else — new users
// have no first-launch surface, so their opt-outs always come through
// Settings).

 * §First-launch experience). Any consent flip they make routes through
 * Settings → Privacy and tags as `'settings'`.
 *
 * Note: the notice's ✕ (silent acknowledge) path does NOT come through this
