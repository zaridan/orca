// kinds ('commit_push', 'commit_sync', 'commit_publish') live in
// DropdownActionKind only — never on the primary — so they are not part
// of this union. Narrowing the type here is load-bearing: it lets
// `handlePrimaryClick` switch exhaustively over only the kinds the
// primary can actually emit, and it kills the compound-commit branch in
// the isRemoteOperationActive tooltip below at compile time.

// Why: the in-flight remote op tracker stores which action the user actually
// triggered, so the primary button can mirror that label/spinner instead of
// claiming a stale or unrelated operation is running. Dropdown-only remote
// kinds are included because they participate in the busy flag, but they are
// intentionally NOT in PrimaryActionKind — when Fetch is in flight the primary
// keeps its natural label, while Force Push maps back to the push icon/slot.
