/**
 * Shared delete-with-toast flow used by both DeleteWorktreeDialog (confirm
 * path) and WorktreeContextMenu (skip-confirm path). Centralizes the error
 * toast copy, the "Force Delete" action wiring, and the "View" affordance so
 * both entry points behave identically from the user's perspective.
 *
 * Why this is a module helper rather than a store action: the behavior is
 * intrinsically UI-shaped — it shows sonner toasts, registers action/cancel
 * handlers, and depends on `activateAndRevealWorktree` (a renderer-only
 * helper). Keeping it in the renderer layer avoids bleeding toast/UI
 * concerns into the store slice while still preventing the two delete
 * entry points from drifting apart.

/**
 * Shared funnel for the standard (non-folder) delete decision tree, called
 * from both WorktreeContextMenu and MemoryStatusSegment. Mirrors the
 * `runSleepWorktree` pattern: reads state imperatively so the helper can be
 * invoked from any handler without plumbing selectors through props, then
 * branches on the user's `skipDeleteWorktreeConfirm` preference — either
 * running the delete immediately with toast feedback, or opening the
 * confirmation modal.
 *
 * Why folder mode is handled at the call site: folder-repo removal branches
 * to a different modal (`confirm-remove-folder`) and the folder-vs-git
 * determination requires the full Worktree record's repoId. Keeping that
 * decision adjacent to the caller (rather than branching inside this helper)
 * avoids bleeding folder-mode concerns into what is otherwise a simple
 * skip-confirm-vs-modal decision, and lets the context menu short-circuit
 * before ever entering this funnel.
 *
 * The main-worktree / missing-record guard here is defense-in-depth — the
 * caller is responsible for disabling UI when this is known ahead of time,
 * but we still refuse to act if the record disappeared between render and
 * click (e.g. a concurrent delete or state reset).
