/**
 * DECSET 2031 color-scheme responder for parked terminals (byte-scan mode).
 *
 * Why a dedicated byte sidecar: no xterm exists while a tab is parked, so
 * nothing answers a TUI's mode-2031 theme subscription. Query authority stays
 * with the view/watcher (model/view contract invariant 6), so this reply can
 * never move to main. Phase 4: this subscribeToPtyData registration doubles
 * as a delivery-interest signal, so it is only used while the hidden-delivery
 * gate is OFF — gated parked PTYs answer from the main tracker's
 * '2031-subscribe' fact instead (parked-terminal-byte-watcher.ts).
 *
 * Survives Phase 6 (skip-grammar deletion): mounted switch-off hidden panes
 * answer 2031 from xterm once the background queue drains, but a PARKED tab
 * has no xterm in any switch-off mode, and the '2031-subscribe' fact is only
 * consumed while the gate is ON — this sidecar stays the only answerer here.
